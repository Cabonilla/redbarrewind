### Adding Entries

Click on the + button to add your video's current timestamp to a locally saved repository. This timestamp will remain after you've refreshed the page.

*Note: You cannot add two entries at the same timestamp.*

To edit, hold click on the entry to enable the input again and enter your new label. To close the bookmark, click on the original RedbarRewind overlay.

Enter your label into the input that appears and press ENTER or click outside of the label to save.

The + button also allows users to enter their bookmark entries automatically via test file. Create a text file with the following ***example*** format:

<pre>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRd5NIm67L8 
00:12:00 - He is eating.
00:15:00 - He is not eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHsCb-dDGnU
01:12:00 - Something is happening.
02:12:08 - Something else happens.</pre>

Then drag and drop the file onto the + button to enter multiple entries at once.
